# GAAC Project Rules
- Everything about this project, including but not limited to implementations, comments, tests and documentations should be in English. No Emoji or CJK char is allowed.
- **MANDATORY**: Every commit MUST include a version bump in both `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. This applies to ALL commits without exception - bug fixes, features, documentation changes, etc. Increment the patch version (e.g., 1.0.1 -> 1.0.2) for each commit.
